This project integrates Chiplet design into ECG signal processing, demonstrating the potential of modular circuits in improving performance and efficiency. 
The high-pass filter (0.339 Hz cutoff) effectively removed DC components, while the low-pass filter (249 Hz cutoff) significantly reduced high-frequency noise. 
**Analysis of percent yields during manufacturing and its economic impact will be included in future updates.**
These findings highlight Chiplet design's feasibility and broad application potential in signal processing and beyond, paving the way for continued innovation in the semiconductor industry.
