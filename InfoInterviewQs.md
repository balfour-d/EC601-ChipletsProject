# Professor Herbordt
- What modeling software (if any) do you use when working with FPGAs? Do you have any FPGA models that could be applied and adapted for this project?
- What kind of breakdown would suggest when applying chiplets to an FPGA? What functionalities should we be looking to give each chiplet?
- Do you have any general advice on how to proceed?
- Have you worked with chiplets in the past? Do you have any information on the application of chiplets in FPGA design?
- How feasible do you believe our project is? How would you suggest focusing our project so that it can be completed within a semester?

# Evan Lang
- How do you model chiplets?
- Did you work on chiplet FPGA? Is there any design guidance you can offer?
- What is the size cap on functionality per chiplet? (How much is too much to make one chiplet do?)
