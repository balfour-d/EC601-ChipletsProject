# Professor Herbordt
- What modeling software (if any) do you use when working with FPGAs? Do you have any FPGA models that could be applied and adapted for this project?
- What kind of breakdown would suggest when applying chiplets to an FPGA? What functionalities should we be looking to give each chiplet?
- Do you have any general advice on how to proceed?
- Have you worked with chiplets in the past? Do you have any information on the application of chiplets in FPGA design?
- How feasible do you believe our project is? How would you suggest focusing our project so that it can be completed within a semester?
- Do you think it is feasible to use Chiplet and FPGA to create a multi-sensor integration platform or AI reasoning acceleration platform for autonomous intelligent driving?
- Or can we study the issues related to adaptive baud rate by combining chiplet and FPGA?
- For a basic chiplet to be implemented on top of an fpga, what features should it have?

# Evan Lang
- How do you model chiplets? (we are contemplating Altium Designer or LTspice)
- What is the size cap on functionality per chiplet? (How much is too much to make one chiplet do?)
- If we choose DAC, should we focus on making one module or should we make every module?
- Do we need to integrate or personalize related modules?
- Should we focus on extensive simulation for individual chiplets or prioritize integration testing early in the process?
- What communication protocols should we use between chiplets?
