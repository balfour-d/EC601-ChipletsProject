Possible project topics
- interconnectivity
- open sim - simulating chiplets
- learn how to build system-on-a-chip (is there a simulator, is there software, etc)
-    what system-on-a-chip

-    do a literature review on busses and see what we want to implement, standardization, compare multiple solutions

- how different nanotechnologies can work together in the same chiplet, (more R&D and understanding)


# Project:
- looking into the building and implementation of a system-on-a-chip

# Before next meeting: 
- look into simulators and software to build/implement
- look into research papers related to design of systems
- email professor about student who works with chiplets

# Next Meeting:
- determine feasibility of build/implementation
- determine what product we want to design
- complete project definition, user stories, MVP
- collate sources and complete paper
