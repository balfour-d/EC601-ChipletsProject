# EC601-ChipletsProject

Project Definition: For product designers looking for a cheaper, more adaptable, and more scalable product, this FPGA is redesigned using chiplets.


Target Users: The main users of this product would be product designers, as they would be the ones directly implementing this FPGA in their systems. However, the end user would also benefit from the improved performance of a chiplet design versus a monolithic design.


User Stories: 
As a product designer, I want improved performance.
As a product designer, I want a design that is easily modified.
As a product designer, I want a design that is easily scalable.
As a product designer, I want a cheaper design.
As a user, I want a product with improved performance.
As a user, I want a product that operates faster.


MVP:
As a product designer, I want improved performance.
As a product designer, I want a design that is easily modified.
As a product designer, I want a design that is easily scalable.
