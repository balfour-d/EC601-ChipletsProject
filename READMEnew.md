# EC601-ChipletsProject

## Project Definition: 
For product designers looking for a cheaper, more adaptable, and more scalable product, this circuit is redesigned using chiplets.


## Target Users: 
The main users of this product would be product designers, as they would be the ones directly implementing this circuit in their systems. However, the end user would also benefit from the improved performance of a chiplet design versus a monolithic design.


## User Stories: 
As a product designer, I want the ADC/DAC system to be more modular, making it easier to maintain and upgrade.<br>
As a product designer, I want to reduce the complexity and cost of design through chiplet technology.<br>
As a product designer, I want to easily scale up or down the ADC/DAC functionalities according to different application needs.<br>
As a product designer, I want the chiplet design to ensure more stable and precise performance.<br>
As a product designer, I want the design to reduce cost and be easy to modify.<br>
As a product designer, I want the design to improve performance and precision.<br>
As an end user, I want the system to provide higher accuracy and speed, improving overall efficiency.<br>
As an end user, I want to easily integrate and use the product across different applications.<br>
