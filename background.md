(ECG) signal and chiplet background info

In recent years, with the popularity of portable and telemedicine devices, the demand for low-cost, energy-efficient, and high-precision ECG signal processing solutions has been growing. As an important non-invasive diagnostic tool in the medical field, electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used to record and analyze the electrical activity of the heart, and plays a key role in detecting arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and other cardiac diseases.
However, ECG signals are susceptible to environmental noise and equipment interference, such as power supply frequencies (e.g., 60 Hz) and their harmonics. These interferences, which are usually clearly observable through spectral analysis, originate mainly from the surrounding environment's alternating current (AC) or from the power supply noise of the device itself. When unfiltered, these periodic noises may mask key features in the ECG signal (e.g., P-waves, QRS wave clusters, and T-waves), thus affecting diagnostic accuracy and the identification of rhythm abnormalities. Therefore, in the experiment, the 60 Hz and 120 Hz interferences were effectively removed by a trap filter in the digital domain, which significantly improved the signal quality and provided a more reliable data base for ECG analysis.
Chiplet technology, as a new paradigm of modular design, provides new possibilities for optimizing the performance of ECG devices. By breaking down complex signal processing tasks into separate functional modules, Chiplet technology not only reduces development and manufacturing costs, but also significantly increases the flexibility and adaptability of devices. In ECG signal processing, core grain technology demonstrates the advantages of modular design, efficient signal processing and flexible scalability, while reducing overall costs and making advanced medical technology available to a wider user base. In the future, ECG devices are expected to become more efficient, smarter, and more accessible through the introduction of the innovative architecture of the dielectric, which will have a profound impact on technological innovation in the medical field.

Chiplet technology as a solution to continue Moore's Law
 Moore's law if you continue to rely on the traditional “micro” route from the economic point of view has actually been unsustainable, a single chip on the integration of more transistors, although technically still feasible, but the cost has been unacceptably large.The yield of the advanced process is one of the main factors of the high cost of flow, the large die “cut” into Chiplet is a must to effectively improve the yield of a single wafer, but also to make Moore's Law can be one of the main ways to continue. Chiplet technology not only improves yields, but also further reduces design costs and risks by reusing mature Chiplets, allowing the number of transistors inside a single chip to continue to increase while costs remain acceptable.

Chiplet Technology Background

As Moore's Law approaches its physical and economic limits, the traditional “miniaturization” route (increasing performance and integration by reducing transistor size) faces significant challenges. From a technical point of view, it is still feasible to integrate more transistors onto a single chip, but the manufacturing cost and complexity have become unacceptable, especially in advanced processes (e.g., 5nm, 3nm), where the low yield of wafers further pushes up the overall cost of chip production.
Core die technology has emerged as an important solution to continue Moore's Law. By splitting a single large-size chip (Monolithic Die) into multiple functionally independent small chips (Chiplet) and integrating these chips together through advanced packaging technologies, not only does it improve the yield of a single wafer, but it also significantly reduces the cost of production and design. Chiplet technology allows for the reuse of proven chip modules, thereby reducing design risk while keeping performance growth and costs manageable.
This modular design advantage allows the number of transistors in a single chip to continue to grow while manufacturing and design costs become more economically viable. As a result, die technology is seen as one of the key ways to continue Moore's Law and advance semiconductor technology.

Background Information on Chiplet Technology in the Medical Field
As medical technology evolves, the demand for portable, high-performance, low-power medical devices is growing rapidly. For example, electrocardiogram (ECG) devices, wearable health monitoring devices, and portable ultrasound devices require highly integrated and flexible hardware designs to meet complex data processing and real-time monitoring requirements. In this context, Chiplet technology is an important solution for medical device hardware optimization due to its modular design, efficiency and flexibility.
