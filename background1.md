In recent years, with the popularity of portable and telemedicine devices, there has been a growing demand for low-cost, energy-efficient and highly accurate electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing solutions. As an important non-invasive diagnostic tool, ECG is widely used to record and analyze the electrical activity of the heart, which plays an important role in detecting arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and other diseases. However, ECG signals are susceptible to environmental noise and equipment interference (e.g., 60 Hz power supply frequency and its harmonics), which can mask key features in the signals (e.g., P-waves, QRS wave clusters, and T-waves), thus affecting the diagnostic accuracy. The effective removal of 60 Hz and 120 Hz interference by digital domain traps significantly improves signal quality and provides a more reliable data base for ECG analysis.

Chiplet technology, as a new paradigm of modular design, offers new possibilities for optimizing the performance of ECG devices. By breaking down complex signal processing tasks into independent modules, Chiplet technology not only reduces development and manufacturing costs, but also significantly improves the flexibility and adaptability of equipment. In ECG signal processing, core particle technology demonstrates the advantages of modular design, efficient processing and flexible expansion, while reducing overall costs and making advanced medical technology more widely available. In the future, through the introduction of innovative architectures, ECG devices will become more efficient, intelligent and accessible, with far-reaching impact on medical technology innovation.
