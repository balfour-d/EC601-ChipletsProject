With the development of portable and telemedicine devices, the demand for low-cost, high-precision electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing has increased.ECG is widely used for heart disease detection but is susceptible to interference from ambient noise such as 60 Hz. Signal quality is significantly improved by removing the interference with digital traps. Chiplet technology makes advanced medical technology more accessible by breaking down signal processing tasks into modules, reducing development costs, increasing flexibility, and supporting efficient processing and functionality expansion to enable accurate signal analysis and customized design in ECG devices. In the future, corelet technology will drive ECG devices to be more efficient, intelligent and accessible.
